<h3>Background information</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  This study is being conducted as part of research into techniques to improve <b class="sentimentgreen">sentiment analysis</b> on twitter data.  
  Essentially, this involves collecting a large number of tweets from twitter and building 
  a system that can be "trained" on some of these tweets to be able to decide whether or not 
  a tweet is positive or negative.  This is the sort of thing that can be useful to companies
  who want to know how the public is reacting to their product releases.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  For example, if people tweet: 
</p>
<br>
<p class="tweetcolor">
  "The new iphone is powerful, but I hate how heavy it is #applegravity #Newtonwouldlikeit"
</p>
<br>
<p>
  then by performing sentiment analysis, Apple can ascertain that there is a positive response to the iphone processor power, but a negative response to its weight.  This information ( particularly when extracted from 
  hundreds of thousands of tweets) forms a valuable source of customer feedback.  It can be performed on a far larger scale than a survery and often offers a truer reflection of the users opinion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    However, sarcasm makes this task very difficult.  It is comparatively simple to build a system that classifies the tweet from words that are associated with clearly positive or negative feelings (e.g 
    <em class="sentimentgreen">powerful</em> and <em class="sentimentred"> heavy</em> in the tweet above).  However, consider the following tweet:
</p>
<br>
<p class="tweetcolor">
  "I just love the new Samsung. It's incredible. So, so fast. #sarcasm"
</p>
<br>
<p> 
    A system that isn't trained to deal with sarcasm will see <em class="sentimentgreen">love</em>, <em class="sentimentgreen">incredible</em> and <em class="sentimentgreen">fast</em>, and classify the tweet as positive, which doesn't reflect the sentiment of the user at all!
</p>
<br>
<p>
    As part of my research, I have designed a system that aims to classify sarcastic tweets to deal with this problem.  However, in order to test the effectiveness of the system, I need to compare it against humans.  The purpose of this study is establish a human benchmark for the difficulty of the task of deciding whether or not a tweet is sarcastic.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<br>
<p>
You will be presented with a series of tweets, one at a time, together with other replies or tweets that were part of that conversation (if there were any).  The task is simply to note whether you believe the intended meaning of the original tweet was sarcastic or not sarcastic.  The tweets themselves have been made anonymous as far as possible - the username of the tweeter has been removed and any tweets directed at a specific user have had the name of that user replaced with @SomeUser.  Some of the tweets are badly formed, ambiguous or unclear.  In such cases, just give your best guess as to the intention of the original tweet author.  As a participator, no personal information of yours will be stored after the study or used in any form of publication. The information that you contribute as a participant will be used entirely anonymously.
</p>
<br>
<p>
There is no time limit in which to classify tweets.  There is no minimum or maximum number that you are required to classify.  However, as a guide, if you feel you are able to comfortably classify 200 tweets, this would be very useful for the purposes of the research.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
  In order to make the study more interesting, the more tweets that you classify, the more you will increase your 'level' as a participant, allowing you to unlock themed images.  This is purely to make the task more enjoyable.  The data relating to the levels of particpants will not recorded.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If you feel tired or uncomfortable, please take a break.  You may logout at any time and log back in at any time.  If you wish to abandon the study, you are completely free to do so at any time.  The results are recorded as tweets are classified, so to complete the task, simply log out of the application.
